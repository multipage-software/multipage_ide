# multipage_ide
Multipage IDE with Maclan macrolanguage. Development of software elements.

You are welcome to download source code so that the IDE can be developed and improved together. It could be bridge to Python, better GUI and intellisense, better overall perfomance or other improvements that I cannot imagine yet.
